# Is it worth to buy a house in California?
### Possible Questions :
<li>Are there different housing price in counties? Why?</li><br>
<li>How time affect the housing price? Why?</li><br>
<li>Metrics to choose the best place and house for buyer</li>

### Datasets :
<http://www.zillow.com/research/data/><br>
<http://school-ratings.com/counties/Alameda.html?type=HS&rankFilter=10>
### Plan : 
At first, we will extract the dataset of housing price in California from zillow.com and combine the time-series dataset. Visualize the dataset to observe the interesting things from dataset. Because the dataset has lots of missing values, we will try to predict missing values to have better prediction.
