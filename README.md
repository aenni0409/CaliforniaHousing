# Is it worth to buy a house in California?
### Possible Questions :
<li>Are there different housing price in counties? Why?</li><br>
<li>How does time affect the housing price? Why?</li><br>
<li>Metrics to choose the best place and house for buyer</li>

### Datasets :
[Zillow](http://www.zillow.com/research/data/)<br>
[School Rating](http://school-ratings.com/counties/Alameda.html?type=HS&rankFilter=10)
[U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045216/06)
[Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://ucr.fbi.gov)


### Plan : 
At first, we will extract the dataset of housing price in California from zillow.com and combine the time-series dataset. Visualize the dataset to observe the interesting things from dataset. Because the dataset has lots of missing values, we will try to predict missing values to have better prediction.
