<h3> Purpose </h3>
    <p> According to statistics from U.S. Census Bureau in 2016, the median housing price in California is much higher than thoes 
    in U.S for over 50,000 dollars. The reasons are not only overwhelm demanding from residents or prospective residents but also the 
    extraordinary price changes inside California. Although the median housing price is relatively high, we still can know more about 
    regions where are worthwhile to invest and where should be avoided buying house with unreasonable price. 
    Therefore, in this project, we will use Zillow housing price data for each counties in California and some features to find the 
    best combination of feature of house with housing price and let people know more about housing price in California.
